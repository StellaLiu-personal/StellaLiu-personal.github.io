    <p>Inspired and naive as a 21-yr old, I moved to SE Asia to pursue my love of travel and surfing. That is where I came across yoga for the first time in Bali at the beautiful Yoga Barn in Ubud. That pivotal first yoga class sparked a journey and discovery of both myself and others that finally led me to partake in YTT in the fall of 2019. I am excited hold space for students to practice and learn, and I hope to find deeper connectivity with others in the form of assisting and teaching.
